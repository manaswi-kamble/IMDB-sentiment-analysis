As the story unfolds in real life and fiction, Sparrow must figure out his connection to the book and how the story will eventually end.<br /><br />The Number 23 offers an intriguing premise that is undone by a weak execution. The film just failed on many different levels which is pretty disappointing because it held so much potential. The screenplay was probably the worst part about it. It was filled with silly sequences and laughable dialog that just killed the mood of the movie. It seemed like the screenwriter had a good idea, he just didn't know how to develop it to stretch over a ninety minute running time. The second half of the film was running low on ideas, the twist was pretty obvious and the ending was awful.<br /><br />Joel Schumacher is responsible for one of the worst movies ever and he did redeem himself a little with Phone Booth and a few other films but The Number 23 reminds me that he's still capable of making a stinker. He has the movie drenched in style but he just can't get a good focus. He moves the film at a clunky and slow pace. He switches from reality to what's actually happening in the book which quickly got annoying. The actual book in the film that's titled \\\"The Number 23\\\" is an awful detective story and the audience gets stuck listening to Carrey narrate it which just bored me to tears. When Carrey is finally done with book, we get stuck watching him run around trying to solve the mystery. At this point, the audience has lost interest and there is no real tension. We impatiently wait for the movie to reach it's horrible ending and unconvincing explanation before celebrating that film has finally finished.<br /><br />The acting was mostly average and pretty forgettable. Jim Carrey was clearly just sleepwalking through his performance and he didn't even seem to be trying. He was either completely over the top in some scenes or just very wooden. His narration was a complete bore to listen to and he put no life inside his character. Virginia Madsen did the best she could with a limited role but she needs to pick better scripts. Logan Lerman was pretty bland as was Danny Huston. Overall, The Number 23 was an awful thriller that offered more laughs than suspense or thrills. Rating 3/10\",\n          \"I cannot believe I enjoyed this as much as I did. The anthology stories were better than par, but the linking story and its surprise ending hooked me. Alot of familiar faces will keep you asking yourself \\\"where I have I seen them before?\\\" Forget the running time listed on New Line's tape, this ain't no 103 minutes, according to my VCR timer and IMDB. Space Maggot douses the campfire in his own special way and hikes this an 8.\",\n          \"Caddyshack Two is a good movie by itself but compared to the original it cant stack up. Robert Stack is a horrible replacement for Ted Knight and Jackie Mason, while funny just cant compete with Rodney Dangerfield. Ty Webb is funny, being the only character from the original. Most of the other characters in the movie lack the punch of the original (Henry Wilcoxon for example) except for the hystericly funny lawyer Peter Blunt, being played by Randy Quaid. Every line he says reminds me of the originals humor, especially the scene at his office (I don't go in for law suits or motions. I find out where you live and come to your house and beat down your door with a f***ing baseball bat, make a bonfire with the chippindale,maybe roast that golden retriever (arff arff arff) then eat it. And then I'm comin' upstairs junior, and I'm grabbing you by your brooks brothers pjs, and cramming your brand new BMW up your tight a**! Do we have an understanding?). Offsetting his small role however, is Dan Acroyd, who is obviously no replacement for Bill Murray. His voice is beyond irritating and everything he does isnt even funny, its just stupid. Overall Caddyshack II is a good movie, but in comparison to the awesome original it just cant cut it.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"sentiment\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"negative\",\n          \"positive\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

As the story unfolds in real life and fiction, Sparrow must figure out his connection to the book and how the story will eventually end.<br /><br />The Number 23 offers an intriguing premise that is undone by a weak execution. The film just failed on many different levels which is pretty disappointing because it held so much potential. The screenplay was probably the worst part about it. It was filled with silly sequences and laughable dialog that just killed the mood of the movie. It seemed like the screenwriter had a good idea, he just didn't know how to develop it to stretch over a ninety minute running time. The second half of the film was running low on ideas, the twist was pretty obvious and the ending was awful.<br /><br />Joel Schumacher is responsible for one of the worst movies ever and he did redeem himself a little with Phone Booth and a few other films but The Number 23 reminds me that he's still capable of making a stinker. He has the movie drenched in style but he just can't get a good focus. He moves the film at a clunky and slow pace. He switches from reality to what's actually happening in the book which quickly got annoying. The actual book in the film that's titled \\\"The Number 23\\\" is an awful detective story and the audience gets stuck listening to Carrey narrate it which just bored me to tears. When Carrey is finally done with book, we get stuck watching him run around trying to solve the mystery. At this point, the audience has lost interest and there is no real tension. We impatiently wait for the movie to reach it's horrible ending and unconvincing explanation before celebrating that film has finally finished.<br /><br />The acting was mostly average and pretty forgettable. Jim Carrey was clearly just sleepwalking through his performance and he didn't even seem to be trying. He was either completely over the top in some scenes or just very wooden. His narration was a complete bore to listen to and he put no life inside his character. Virginia Madsen did the best she could with a limited role but she needs to pick better scripts. Logan Lerman was pretty bland as was Danny Huston. Overall, The Number 23 was an awful thriller that offered more laughs than suspense or thrills. Rating 3/10\",\n          \"I cannot believe I enjoyed this as much as I did. The anthology stories were better than par, but the linking story and its surprise ending hooked me. Alot of familiar faces will keep you asking yourself \\\"where I have I seen them before?\\\" Forget the running time listed on New Line's tape, this ain't no 103 minutes, according to my VCR timer and IMDB. Space Maggot douses the campfire in his own special way and hikes this an 8.\",\n          \"Caddyshack Two is a good movie by itself but compared to the original it cant stack up. Robert Stack is a horrible replacement for Ted Knight and Jackie Mason, while funny just cant compete with Rodney Dangerfield. Ty Webb is funny, being the only character from the original. Most of the other characters in the movie lack the punch of the original (Henry Wilcoxon for example) except for the hystericly funny lawyer Peter Blunt, being played by Randy Quaid. Every line he says reminds me of the originals humor, especially the scene at his office (I don't go in for law suits or motions. I find out where you live and come to your house and beat down your door with a f***ing baseball bat, make a bonfire with the chippindale,maybe roast that golden retriever (arff arff arff) then eat it. And then I'm comin' upstairs junior, and I'm grabbing you by your brooks brothers pjs, and cramming your brand new BMW up your tight a**! Do we have an understanding?). Offsetting his small role however, is Dan Acroyd, who is obviously no replacement for Bill Murray. His voice is beyond irritating and everything he does isnt even funny, its just stupid. Overall Caddyshack II is a good movie, but in comparison to the awesome original it just cant cut it.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"sentiment\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

that struck me about oz was its brutality and unflinching scenes of violence  which set in right from the word go  trust me  this is not a show for the faint hearted or timid  this show pulls no punches with regards to drugs  sex or violence  its is hardcore  in the classic use of the word  br    br   it is called oz as that is the nickname given to the oswald maximum security state penitentary  it focuses mainly on emerald city  an experimental section of the prison where all the cells have glass fronts and face inwards  so privacy is not high on the agenda  em city is home to many  aryans  muslims  gangstas  latinos  christians  italians  irish and more    so scuffles  death stares  dodgy dealings and shady agreements are never far away  br    br   i would say the main appeal of the show is due to the fact that it goes where other shows wouldn t dare  forget pretty pictures painted for mainstream audiences  forget charm  forget romance   oz doesn t mess around  the first episode i ever saw struck me as so nasty it was surreal  i couldn t say i was ready for it  but as i watched more  i developed a taste for oz  and got accustomed to the high levels of graphic violence  not just violence  but injustice  crooked guards who ll be sold out for a nickel  inmates who ll kill on order and get away with it  well mannered  middle class inmates being turned into prison bitches due to their lack of street skills or prison experience  watching oz  you may become comfortable with what is uncomfortable viewing    thats if you can get in touch with your darker side ', 'a wonderful little production   br    br   the filming technique is very unassuming  very old time bbc fashion and gives a comforting  and sometimes discomforting  sense of realism to the entire piece   br    br   the actors are extremely well chosen  michael sheen not only  has got all the polari  but he has all the voices down pat too  you can truly see the seamless editing guided by the references to williams  diary entries  not only is it well worth the watching but it is a terrificly written and performed piece  a masterful production about one of the great master s of comedy and his life   br    br   the realism really comes home with the little things  the fantasy of the guard which  rather than use the traditional  dream  techniques remains solid then disappears  it plays on our knowledge and our senses  particularly with the scenes concerning orton and halliwell and the sets  particularly of their flat with halliwell s murals decorating every surface  are terribly well done ', 'i thought this was a wonderful way to spend time on a too hot summer weekend  sitting in the air conditioned theater and watching a light hearted comedy  the plot is simplistic  but the dialogue is witty and the characters are likable  even the well bread suspected serial killer   while some may be disappointed when they realize this is not match point 2  risk addiction  i thought it was proof that woody allen is still fully in control of the style many of us have grown to love  br    br   this was the most i d laughed at one of woody s comedies in years  dare i say a decade    while i ve never been impressed with scarlet johanson  in this she managed to tone down her  sexy  image and jumped right into a average  but spirited young woman  br    br   this may not be the crown jewel of his career  but it was wittier than  devil wears prada  and more interesting than  superman  a great comedy to go see with friends ', 'basically there s a family where a little boy  jake  thinks there s a zombie in his closet   his parents are fighting all the time  br    br   this movie is slower than a soap opera    and suddenly  jake decides to become rambo and kill the zombie  br    br   ok  first of all when you re going to make a film you must decide if its a thriller or a drama  as a drama the movie is watchable  parents are divorcing   arguing like in real life  and then we have jake with his closet which totally ruins all the film  i expected to see a boogeyman similar movie  and instead i watched a drama with some meaningless thriller spots  br    br   3 out of 10 just for the well playing parents   descent dialogs  as for the shots with jake  just ignore them ', 'petter mattei s  love in the time of money  is a visually stunning film to watch  mr  mattei offers us a vivid portrait about human relations  this is a movie that seems to be telling us what money  power and success do to people in the different situations we encounter   br    br   this being a variation on the arthur schnitzler s play about the same theme  the director transfers the action to the present time new york where all these different characters meet and connect  each one is connected in one way  or another to the next person  but no one seems to know the previous point of contact  stylishly  the film has a sophisticated luxurious look  we are taken to see how these people live and the world they live in their own habitat  br    br   the only thing one gets out of all these souls in the picture is the different stages of loneliness each one inhabits  a big city is not exactly the best place in which human relations find sincere fulfillment  as one discerns is the case with most of the people we encounter  br    br   the acting is good under mr  mattei s direction  steve buscemi  rosario dawson  carol kane  michael imperioli  adrian grenier  and the rest of the talented cast  make these characters come alive  br    br   we wish mr  mattei good luck

old  despite my having seen it some 15 or more times in the last 25 years  paul lukas  performance brings tears to my eyes  and bette davis  in one of her very few truly sympathetic roles  is a delight  the kids are  as grandma says  more like  dressed up midgets  than children  but that only makes them more fun to watch  and the mother s slow awakening to what s happening in the world and under her own roof is believable and startling  if i had a dozen thumbs  they d all be  up  for this movie ', 'i sure would like to see a resurrection of a up dated seahunt series with the tech they have today it would bring back the kid excitement in me i grew up on black and white tv and seahunt with gunsmoke were my hero s every week you have my vote for a comeback of a new sea hunt we need a change of pace in tv and this would work for a world of under water adventure oh by the way thank you for an outlet like this to view many viewpoints about tv and the many movies so any ole way i believe i ve got what i wanna say would be nice to read some more plus points about sea hunt if my rhymes would be 10 lines would you let me submit or leave me out to be in doubt and have me to quit

that  by 1990  the show was not really funny anymore  and it s continued its decline further to the complete waste of time it is today  br    br   it s truly disgraceful how far this show has fallen  the writing is painfully bad  the performances are almost as bad   if not for the mildly entertaining respite of the guest hosts  this show probably wouldn t still be on the air  i find it so hard to believe that the same creator that hand selected the original cast also chose the band of hacks that followed  how can one recognize such brilliance and then see fit to replace it with such mediocrity  i felt i must give 2 stars out of respect for the original cast that made this show such a huge success  as it is now  the show is just awful  i can t believe it s still on the air ', 'encouraged by the positive comments about this film on here i was looking forward to watching this film  bad mistake  i ve seen 950+ films and this is truly one of the worst of them   it s awful in almost every way  editing  pacing  storyline   acting   soundtrack  the film s only song   a lame country tune   is played no less than four times   the film looks cheap and nasty and is boring in the extreme  rarely have i been so happy to see the end credits of a film   br    br   the only thing that prevents me giving this a 1 score is harvey keitel   while this is far from his best performance he at least seems to be making a bit of an effort  one for keitel obsessives only ', 'if you like original gut wrenching laughter you will like this movie  if you are young or old then you will love this movie

at first it was very odd and pretty funny but as the movie progressed i didn t find the jokes or oddness funny anymore  br    br   its a low budget film  thats never a problem in itself   there were some pretty interesting characters  but eventually i just lost interest  br    br   i imagine this film would appeal to a stoner who is currently partaking  br    br   for something similar but better try  brother from another planet ', 'i saw this movie when i was about 12 when it came out  i recall the scariest scene was the big bird eating men dangling helplessly from parachutes right out of the air  the horror  the horror  br    br   as a young kid going to these cheesy b films on saturday afternoons  i still was tired of the formula for these monster type movies that usually included the hero  a beautiful woman who might be the daughter of a professor and a happy resolution when the monster died in the end  i didn t care much for the romantic angle as a 12 year old and the predictable plots  i love them now for the unintentional humor  br    br   but  about a year or so later  i saw psycho when it came out and i loved that the star  janet leigh  was bumped off early in the film  i sat up and took notice at that point  since screenwriters are making up the story  make it up to be as scary as possible and not from a well worn formula  there are no rules ', 'so im not a big fan of boll s work but then again not many are  i enjoyed his movie postal  maybe im the only one   boll apparently bought the rights to use far cry long ago even before the game itself was even finsished

eating dudes    however i find that tils acting in this movie is pretty badass   people have complained about how he s not really staying true to the whole carver agenda but we only saw carver in a first person perspective so we don t really know what he looked like when he was kicking a      br    br   however  the storyline in this film is beyond demented  we see the evil mad scientist dr  krieger played by udo kier  making genetically mutated soldiers or gms as they are called  performing his top secret research on an island that reminds me of  spoiler  vancouver for some reason  thats right no palm trees here  instead we got some nice rich lumberjack woods  we haven t even gone far before i started to cry  mehehe  i cannot go on any more   if you wanna stay true to bolls shenanigans then go and see this movie you will not be disappointed it delivers the true boll experience  meaning most of it will suck  br    br   there are some things worth mentioning that would

same title  liam neeson was excellent as he always is  and most of the cast holds up  with the exception of owen wilson  who just did not bring the right feel to the character of luke  but the major fault with this version is that it strayed too far from the shirley jackson story in it s attempts to be grandiose and lost some of the thrill of the earlier film in a trade off for snazzier special

than a fascinating journey of the most mysterious subject matter ever studied  br    br   i like how the movie does not bog us down with too much scientific jargon trying to explain how jennifer lopez actually gets to enter the brain of another  instead  she just lies down on a laboratory table and is wrapped with what looks like really long twizzlers and jaunted into another entity   the cell  wants to let you  see  what it s all about and not  how  it s all about  and i guess that s what some people don t like  true  i do like explanations with my movies  but when a movie ventures onto new

corporatization of war  but poking fun at it in this way diminishes the true atrocity of what is happening  reminds me a bit of three kings  which similarly trivializes a genuine cause for concern ',

top action sequences seem unavoidable for any conflict dealing with large scale combat  once in a while  however  a war movie comes along that goes against the grain and brings a truly original and compelling story to life on the silver screen  the civil war era  cold mountain   starring jude law  nicole kidman and renée zellweger is such a film  br    br   then again  calling cold mountain  a war movie is not entirely accurate  true enough  the film opens with a  quite literally  quick and dirty battle sequence that puts  glory  director edward zwick shame  however   cold mountain  is not so much about the civil war itself as it is about the period and the people of the times  the story centers around disgruntled confederate soldier inman  played by jude law  who becomes disgusted with the gruesome war and homesick for the beautiful hamlet of cold mountain  north carolina and the equally beautiful southern belle he left behind  ada monroe  played by nicole kidman  at first glance  this setup appears formulaic as the romantic interest back home gives the audience enough sympathy to root for the reluctant soldier s tribulations on the battlefield  indeed  the earlier segments of the film are relatively unimpressive and even somewhat contrived  br    br    cold mountain  soon takes a drastic turn  though  as the intrepid hero inman turns out to be a deserter  incidentally saving the audience from the potentially confusing scenario of wanting to root for the confederates  and begins a long odyssey homeward  meanwhile  back at the farm  ada s cultured ways prove of little use in the fields  soon she is transformed into something of a wilderbeast  coming to ada s rescue is the course  tough as nails ruby thewes  played by renée zellweger  who helps ada put the farm back together and  perhaps more importantly  cope with the loneliness and isolation the war seems to have brought upon ada  br    br   within these two settings  a vivid  compelling and  at times  very disturbing portrait of the war torn south unfolds  the characters with whom inman and ada interact are surprisingly complex  enhanced by wonderful performances of brendan gleeson as ruby s deadbeat father  ray winstone as an unrepentant southern  lawman   and natalie portman as a deeply troubled and isolated young mother  all have been greatly affected and changed by  the war of northern aggression   mostly for the worse  the dark  pervading anti war message  accented by an effective  haunting score and chillingly beautiful shots of virginia and north carolina  is communicated to the audience not so much by gruesome battle scenes as by the scarred land and traumatized people for which the war was fought  though the weapons and tactics of war itself have changed much in the past century  it s hellish effect on the land is timelessly relevant  br    br   director anthony minghella manages to maintain this gloomy mood for most of the film  but the atmosphere is unfortunately denigrated by a rather tepid climax that does little justice to the wonderfully formed characters  the love story between inman and ada is awkwardly tacked onto the beginning and end of the film  though the inherently distant  abstracted and even absurd nature of their relationship in a way fits the dismal nature of the rest of the plot  br    br   make no mistake   cold mountain  has neither the traits of a feel good romance nor an inspiring war drama  it is a unique vision of an era that is sure not only to entertain but also to truly absorb the audience into the lives of a people torn apart by a war and entirely desperate to be rid of its terrible repercussions altogether ', 'taut and organically gripping  edward dmytryk s crossfire is a distinctive suspense thriller

politically engaged dmytryk perhaps inevitably succumbs to sermonizing  but it s pretty much confined to young s reminiscence of how his irish grandfather died at the hands of bigots a century earlier

prospect of offending any potential ticket buyer   br    br   but while the change from homophobia to anti semitism works in general  the specifics don t fit so smoothly  the victim s chatting up a

originally from salerno in southern italy  when we re introduced to him at the start of the film  he s been living a non life in an elegant but sterile hotel in the italian speaking canton of switzerland for the last ten years  conducting a business we are only gradually introduced to  while this pivotal yet apparently unremarkable scene takes place employees of the the swiss bank who normally count di girolamo s cash tell him that 10 000 dollars are missing from his usual suitcase full of tightly stacked banknotes  at the news  he quietly but icily threatens his coaxing bank manager of wanting to close down his account  meanwhile he tells us  the spectators  that when you bluff  you have to bluff right through to the end without fear of being caught out or appearing ridiculous  he says  you can t bluff for a while and then halfway through  tell the truth  having eventually done this   bluffed only halfway through and told the truth  and having accepted the

man on the verge of 50  a man who won t even reply in kind to chambermaids and waitresses who say hello and goodbye  becomes at one point someone the spectator cares deeply about  at one point in his non life  titta decides to feel concern about appearing  ridiculous   the first half of the film may be described as  slow  by some  it does indeed reveal di girolamo s days and nights in that hotel at an oddly disjoined  deliberate pace  revealing seemingly mundane and irrelevant details  however  scenes that may have seemed unnecessary reveal just how essential they are as this masterfully constructed and innovative film unfolds before your eyes  the existence of titta di girolamo   the man with no imagination  identity or life  the unsympathetic character you unexpectedly end up loving

interesting element was the way in which the film made use of the protagonist s insomnia  not unlike the machinist  and in a far more explicit way  the al pacino film insomnia   le conseguenze dell

one    br    br   the young and sympathetic hotel waitress sofia  played by olivia magnani  grand daughter of the legendary anna  and the memory of titta s best friend  a man whom he hasn t seen in 20

to a man like titta  accepting the consequences of love will have unimaginable consequences  a film without a single scene of sex or violence  a film that unfolds in its own time and concedes nothing to the spectator s expectations  le conseguenze dell amore is a fine representative of that small  quiet  discreet renaissance that has been taking place in italian cinema since the decline of

about  states of grace  and came in with an open mind  i thought that  god s army  was okay  and i thought that maybe dutcher had improved and matured as a filmmaker  the film began with some shaky acting  and i thought   well  maybe it will get better   unfortunately  it never did  the picture starts out by introducing two elders    mormon missionaries    and it seems that the audience will get to know them and grow to care about them  instead  the story degenerates into a highly improbable series of unfortunate events highlighting blatant disobedience by the missionaries  something that undeniably exists  but rarely on the level that dutcher portrays  and it becomes almost laughable  br    br   dutcher s only success in this movie is his successful alienation of his target audience  by unrealistically and inaccurately portraying the lives of mormon missionaries  dutcher accomplishes nothing more than angering his predominantly mormon audience  the film in no way reflects reality  missions are nothing like what dutcher shows  having served a mormon mission myself i can attest to this fact  and gang life in california certainly contains much more explicit language than the occasional mild vulgarity  br    br   the conclusion  which i m assuming was supposed to touch the audience and inspire them to believe that forgiveness is available to all  was both unbelievable  c mon  the entire mission gathers to see this elder sent home    and the mom and the girl are standing right next to each other   and cheesy  next time  dutcher  try making a movie that someone can identify with ', 'this movie struck home for me  being 29  i remember the  80 s and my father working in a factory  i figured  if i worked hard too  if i had pride and never gave up i too could have

laziness  you can t get anywhere  br    br   i would like to know if anyone has this movie on dvd or vhs  it s made for tv  and i just saw it an hour ago  ic an t find it anywhere  i d love to show this to my friends  my pseudo friends  family and other relatives  see what they think and remind them that once upon a time  americans would work for the sake of feeling honor and that we had pride

years  and i only just saw the musical this week  this allowed me to judge the movie without being tainted by what was or wasn t in the musical  however  it tainted me when i watched the musical       br    br   i actually believe michael douglas worked quite well in that role  along with kasey  i think her  let me dance for you scene  is one of the best parts of the movie  a worthwhile addition compared to the musical  the dancers and singing in the movie are much superior to the musical  as well as the cast which is at least 10 times bigger  easier to do in the movie of course   the decors  lighting  dancing  and singing are also much superior in the movie  which should be expected  and was indeed delivered   br    br   the songs that were in common with the musical are better done in the movie  the new ones are quite good ones  and the whole movie just delivers more than the musical in my opinion  especially compared to a musical which has few decors  the one bad point on the movie is the obvious cuts between the actors talking  and dubbed singers during the singing portions for some of the characters  but their dancing is impeccable  and the end product was more enjoyable than the musical', 'protocol is an implausible movie whose only saving grace is that it stars goldie hawn along with a good cast of supporting actors  the story revolves around a ditzy cocktail

twenty or thirty years until the late 1990s when it resurfaced and even showed up on television  in the meantime it had gained in notoriety because pauline kael s the citizen kane book had suggested that the herman mankiewicz   orson welles screenplay for kane was based on sturgis  screenplay here  as is mentioned in the beginning of this thread for the film on the imdb web site  kael overstated her case  br    br   there are about six narrators who take turns dealing with the life of charles foster kane  the newsreel  representing ralston   the henry luce clone   thatcher s memoirs  bernstein  jed leland  susan alexander kane  and raymond the butler  each has his or her different slant on kane  reflecting their faith or disappointment or hatred of the man  and of course each also reveals his or her own failings when they are telling their version of kane s story  this method also leads to frequent overlapping re tellings of the same incident  br    br   this is not the situation in the power and the glory  yes  like kane it is about a legendary business leader   here it is tom garner  spencer tracy   a man who rose from the bottom to being head of the most successful railroad system in the country  but there are only two narrators   they are garner s right hand man henry  ralph morgan  and his wife  sarah padden   this restricts the nearly three dimensional view we get at times of kane in garner  henry  when he narrates  is talking about his boss and friend  whom he respected and loved  his wife is like the voice of the skeptical public   she sees only the flaws in henry  br    br   typical example  although he worked his way up  tom becomes more and more anti labor in his later years  unions are troublemakers  and he does not care to be slowed down by their shenanigans  henry describes tom s confrontation with the union in a major walk out  and how it preoccupied him to the detriment of his home life  but henry s wife reminds him how tom used scabs and violence to end the strike  apparently blowing up the union s headquarters   killing many people   so we have two views of the man but one is pure white and one is pure black  br    br   i m not really knocking the power and the glory for not duplicating kane s success  few films do   including all of orson welles  other films   but i am aware that the story is presented well enough to hold one s interest to the end  and thanks to the performances of tracy and colleen moore as his wife sally  the tragedy of the worldly success of the pair is fully brought home  br    br   when they marry  tom wants to do well  in part  to give his wife and their family the benefits he never had  but in america great business success comes at a cost  tom gets deeply involved with running the railroad empire  he expands it and improves it constantly   but it takes him away from home too much  and he loses touch with sally  and he also notices eve  helen vinson   the younger woman who becomes his mistress  when sally learns of his unfaithful behavior it destroys her  br    br   similarly tom too gets a full shock  which makes him a martyr in the eyes of henry   eve marries tom  and presents him with a son   but it turns out to be eve s son by tom s son tom jr   philip trent   the discovery of this incestuous cuckolding causes tom to shoot himself  br    br   the film is not a total success   the action jumps at times unconvincingly  yet it does make the business seem real  note the scene when tom tells his board of directors about his plans to purchase a small rival train line  and he discusses the use of debentures for financing the plans   sturgis came from a wealthy background  so he could bring in this type of detail  so on the whole it is a first rate film  no citizen kane perhaps  but of interest to movie lovers as an attempt at business realism with social commentary in depression america ', 'average  and surprisingly tame  fulci giallo

with their lot  having their wages cut by 20  by incoming manchu gangsters  they can t do much about their exploitation because none of them are martial arts skilled to take on the gangsters  and their boss  at first they had a minor success in getting liu to impersonate a highly skilled shaolin monk  one of the best comedy sequences   but their rouse got exposed when they pushed the limit of credibility by impersonating one too many times  br    br   act two shows the protagonist wanting to get back at the mob  however  without real martial arts  he embarks on a journey to shaolin temple  to try and infiltrate and learn martial arts on the sly  after some slapstick moments  he finally gets accepted by the abbot  whom he impersonated   but is disappointed at the teaching methods   kinda like mr miyagi s style in karate kid  but instead of painting fences  he gets to erect scaffoldings all around the temple  nothing can keep a good man down  and he unwittingly builds strength  endurance and learns kung fu the unorthodox way  br    br   act three is where the fight fest begins  with cheesy sound effects  each obvious non contact on film is given the maximum impact treatment  but it is rather refreshing watching the fight scenes here  with its wide angled shots to highlight clarity and detail between the sparring partners  and the use of slow motion only to showcase stunts in different angles  you may find the speed of fights a tad too slow  with some pause in between moves  but with yuen wo ping and his style being used ad nausem in hollywood flicks  they sure don t

entertainment business began turning out paranoid and often jingoistic thrillers with war time themes  these thrillers often involved networks of deceptive and skilled operators at work in the shadows among the good  law abiding citizens  knowing the director was at home in this espionage genre  producer jack skirball approached hitchcock about directing a property he owned that dealt with corruption  war time sabotage and a helpless hero thrust into a vortex of coincidence and mistaken identity  the darker elements of the narrative and the sharp wit of literary maven dorothy parker  during her brief stint in hollywood before returning to her bohemian roots in nyc  who co authored the script were a perfect match for hitchcock s sensibilities  br    br   this often neglected film

lives his life vicariously through sir  without sir to need him  he is nothing  or thinks he is  anyway  br    br   this is a character driven film  the plot is secondary to the interaction of the characters  and as such  it requires actors of the highest caliber to bring it to life  finney  only 47 years old  is completely believable as a very old  very sick  petulant  bullying  but brilliant stage actor  he hisses and fumes at his fellow actors even when they re taking their bows  and courtenay is no less convincing as the mincing dresser  who must sometimes act more as a mother than as a valet to his elderly employer  employer is really the wrong term to use  though  for although  technically their relationship is that of employer and employee  most of the time sir and norman act like nothing so much as an old married couple  br    br   yes  there are others in the cast of this movie  but there is no question that the true stars are finney  courtenay  and the marvelous script by ronald harwood  that is not to say that there aren t other fine performances  most notably eileen atkins as the long suffering stage manager madge  there is a wonderful scene where sir and madge talk about old desires  old regrets  and what might have been  br    br   although it doesn t get talked about these days  it is worth remembering that the dresser was nominated for five academy awards

makes this otherwise totally unwatchable piece of stv crap just about bearable  br    br   but be warned  even though the presence of semi naked  quality crumpet makes the going slightly easier  there is still plenty about this film to warrant it being labelled as an ordeal  the acting is wooden and the dialogue is painful  the black humour  as the dvd blurb describes it  is about as funny as a

usually indian movies are at least two to three hours long but this was a very short movie for an indian film  the american actress that played in the movie is from the television hit series heroes

it is not  even though marques houston did appear in  hp3   he played a totally different character  he was  eight years older  in this film  okay   so reid and martin weren t the most talented and couldn t carry a film all by themselves  but to trade on the hp franchise seems to me that there could have made some sort of reference  albeit minor  to the earlier movies  i m sure everyone who wanted to see it was  hoodwinked   into thinking that they were seeing a sequel  not a totally different film with a familiar name  and i m sorry   kym whitley is not funny  and could not hold a candle to the late robin harris  ketty lester  or dc curry in the earlier films  although meagen good and mari morrow are a substantial visual diversion   i have to give this a thumbs down   just

along with some of the most predictable story lines and shallow characters ever seen  the writer obviously bought the playbook  how to write a space disaster movie  and followed it play by play  in

appears to have been written in the hope that the producers would throw  50 million at the project  but  judging by the latter half of the film which contained numerous lame attempts at special effects  the producers could only muster  50 thousand  to learn that the film was nominated for a  special visual effects  emmy has me absolutely gob smacked  br    br   i think a handful of high school students with a pass in media studies could have created more believable effects  br    br   and the plot holes are too numerous to mention  but i will pick one out as an example  now  i m no nasa expert  but surely it s highly implausible that a worker attached to the shuttle simulator would suddenly hold a position of power in the control room when things start to go pear shaped with the program  surely there is someone more experienced at mission control who the program director would call on rather than a twenty nine year old who has not been in the control room before  br    br   the only saving grace for this film is the work of bill campbell  he manages to make a good attempt at salvaging something out of the train wreck that is this script  br    br   i give this film 2 out of 10  with the above average work of bill campbell in the lead role saving it from a lower mark ', 'caddyshack two is a good movie by itself but compared to the original it cant stack up  robert

dummy used in the necro scene is pretty well made but still phony enough looking to ruin the viewing experience  the unearthed dvd is crisp and clear and i haven t made up my mind if this helps or hinders it  if the film was a little grainy it might have added some  creepiness factor  to what was going on  i have no idea why this film has so much hype surrounding it other than the subject matter   but to be honest the necrophilia scenes in films like nekromantik and visitor q among others  are more shocking than in aftermath  all this talk about the film being about loneliness and all other manner of deep philosophy is bull      this is an expensive  beautifully filmed turd  it s not that shocking  it s not that disgusting  if you insist on viewing it   rent it  i give it a 3 for the fact that not many people make explicit movies about necrophilia  there should definitely be a bigger selection for us sickos      the filming is good and it does have some  gore   if watching a rubbery looking doll get cut open is considered gore     but other than that   absolutely nothing going for this over hyped mess  on the other hand   genesis   cerda s  sequel  to aftermath  now available as a  double feature  released by unearthed films  is an absolute masterpiece of a short film  really showing what a good director cerda really is when given the right material  although i

like  when they took a shot of the rumah tumpangan gamin signboard  then there was suddenly mukhsin s voice saying  bismillahhirrahmannirrahim     the scene when he climbed the tree   br    br   it captured malaysian s attitude and in some mild way  sniggering at how pathetic it is  portrayed in the character  for example  even the kids can be really sharp tongued complete with the shrill

keeps saying  hi  kids  into the camera like a buffoon   but i had expectations for entrails of a virgin to be at least a bit of sleazy fun with some good sex scenes and brutal  bloody killings by a weird japanese penetrator  turns out it s way too sleazy for its own good  or bad  or whatever  there s a problem  and one can see this also in the italian sexploitation flick porno holocaust  similar to this in many respects  in not having balance to the sex and violence  too much sex and it will turn into a prototypical porno  and not even with much production quality in comparison with most professional porno movies  and with the killing scenes  there has to be at least a little tack  and maybe just a smidgen of ingenuity  in creating the creature killer whatever  entrails of a virgin

have all their brains in their  other  heads  br    br   in this case  we re given a photo team where the guys are taking some shots of some girls  nothing too salacious  and then by way of a dense fog they stay off at some house one night and are picked off one by one by  a murderer  as he s credited  first off  the director kazuo  gaira  komizu decides he has to put in a quota of random sex scenes early on  we get spliced in  or phoned in  take your pick  clips of one of the photographers having sex with one or more of the girls elsewhere  it looks like it s from another movie  then once settled into the house  there s a  wrestling  scene that s poorly choreographed and shot  yeah  we really need to see him  all  there   and then on to the rape and killings  first the rape  by the photographers  who promise the girls some jobs for their time  then the murderer  who like d amato s creature is simply covered in mud and given a stupid facial  and who for an unknown reason kills the men and or rapes the women one by one  br    br   now  the latter of those  taken by themselves  should be considered the highlights of the movie  this is like saying  however  that the croûtons are the best part of a wretchedly tasting salad  an eye gouging scene  a spike thrown like an olympic event  that scene  actually  is kind of cool   and finally the entrailing of the overly sex crazed girl  whose inconsequential name i can t remember  even  this  becomes disappointing just by not being correct to the title  on top of this  the sex scenes  which become tedious through  gaira  and his indulgence in long takes without cutaways where everything by the japanese censors is blurred anyway  are dubbed over by the actors  you d think that they seem to be enjoying themselves enough  hence the need to let them  speak  for themselves   but the overall feeling from entrails of a virgin is that of a lumpy one  where it s just there to be gawked at and without a shred of suspense or true horror  watch as the last girl left alive  the virgin of the picture  tries to stop the murderer from getting to her  which lasts five minutes as she keeps throwing sticks at him   you just want

figure out his connection to the book and how the story will eventually end  br    br   the number 23 offers an intriguing premise that is undone by a weak execution  the film just failed on many different levels which is pretty disappointing because it held so much potential  the screenplay was probably the worst part about it  it was filled with silly sequences and laughable dialog that just killed the mood of the movie  it seemed like the screenwriter had a good idea  he just didn t know how to develop it to stretch over a ninety minute running time  the second half of the film was running low on ideas  the twist was pretty obvious and the ending was awful  br    br   joel schumacher is responsible for one of the worst movies ever and he did redeem himself a little with phone booth and a few other films but the number 23 reminds me that he s still capable of making a stinker  he has the movie drenched in style but he just can t get a good focus  he moves the film at a clunky and slow pace  he switches from reality to what s actually happening in the book which quickly got annoying  the actual book in the film that s titled  the number 23  is an awful detective story and the audience gets stuck listening to carrey narrate it which just bored me to tears  when carrey is finally done with book  we get stuck watching him run around trying to solve the mystery

creation   thanks for removing the rec xx xx xx from the bottom right hand corner of the screen  i can see how that would have been a distraction from seeing this movie  br    br   and for the record  i  saw  the movie  but did not watch it  the dialogue was incoherent and most of the scenes took place in my grandmother s trailer  i swear to god  br    br   you know what  i m not writing anymore about this  it s just too painful ', 'deanna durbin  nan grey and barbara read are  three smart girls  in this universal film from 1936  which introduces deanna durbin to film audiences  it also stars ray milland  mischa auer  charles winninger  john king  binnie barnes and alice brady  it s a sweet story about three young women  now living in switzerland with their divorced mother  who hear their father  winninger  is marrying again  not having seen him in 10 years and knowing their mother still loves him  they board a ship to america  with the help of the housekeeper nanny  determined to stop the wedding  realizing that the intended  called  precious   barnes  is nothing but a gold digger aided and abetted by her mother  brady   they arrange for her to be introduced to a wealthy count  this is arranged by their father s accountant  king   the man he chooses is a full time drunk  auer   but the girls mistake him for an actual wealthy count  milland   what a mess  br    br   this is a delightful film  not cloying or overly sugary at all  with some nice performances  particularly by auer  milland  barnes and brady  the young women are pretty and all do good work  the emphasis  of course  is on young durbin  who is a natural actress and a beautifully trained singer  in fact  her voice as a youngster is much more even than it would be as an adult   she has no trouble with the high notes  as she did later on because she put too much weight in the middle voice  she sings a delightful  il bacio  in a police station  br    br   one of the nicest things about the film is to see the father  played by charles winninger  not want his children around   until he sees them and gets to know them  barnes as the gold digger isn t all that young  but the girls  mother looks way up there  so the inference probably was the older man seeking his youth with a younger  more glamorous woman  in fact  he finds the youth he was seeking in his daughters  br    br   universal gives durbin the big star buildup here   she has the final shot in the movie  ray milland at this point was still paying his dues  and it will probably be a surprise even to film fans how young and attractive he is  br    br   very entertaining and of course  this led to a sequel and big stardom for deanna ', 'if anyone is wondering why no one makes movies like they used to  with conversation  character and a simple theme of friendship struggling to evolve into something new  better and different  those folks need to take in this film and see top notch writing  directing  and acting that melds into a wonderful evening of observation on how things used to be in italy and england  other days  other times funneled into a terrific comedy of entertainment  made in 1992 with alfred molina  joan plowright  polly walker  josie lawrence  jim broadbent  miranda richardson  and michael kitchens in the major roles  under the brush stroke direction of mike newell  these actors accomplish vividly memorable performances that are photographed with a sublimely subtle painter s eye  reminiscent of the theatrical bedroom farce of the turn of the century  this film might be called a friendship farce that becomes a worthwhile experience in the growth of the romantic nature within each character  and the viewer  too  an artistic telegram on the importance of caring about those around us ', 'i watched this series out of curiosity wanting to see if they could possibly and with all this modern technology out do cecil b  demille s classic epic of 1956  starring charleton heston yul brenner and sir cedric hardwicke  of course  i was let down  yes  they had all the biblical characters correct  but they didn t give us any of the spectacular theatrical scenes  that held your interest throughout the first movie  if you going to have a mini series  you have to have some  rivoting  scenes  the  burning bush   parting the  red sea  drowning  pharohs armies    building sethi s pyramids   could have been done with todays  technology on the scale of blockbuster movies such as  lord of the rings  or the matrix  obviously  they didn t want to leave a lasting impression of  faith and sacrifice   which is much needed in these trouble times ', 'daniel day lewis is the most versatile actor alive  english aristocratic snob in a room with a view  passionate irish thief in in the name of the father  an impudent  violent butcher in gangs of new york  in a performance ten times stronger than adrian brody s in the pianist  and as the outrageous cristy brown with cerebral palsy in my left foot  just to name a few   his roles all influence eachother  but each is seperate  and utterly unique  he changes completely  with each character he takes on  and i m beginning to believe that he can act as anything  anything  br    br   as cristy brown he is stunning  he does not ridicule the character  and he does not pity the character  a difficult achievement  and cristy brown comes to life  a smart man  an outrageous man  human  br    br   this movie  despite small scene transition faults and the like  is an inspiration  yes  it s predictable  but is it stupidly sentimental  no  i laughed  i cried  not a single moment of cheese  proof that this isn t a hollywood movie  br    br   my favourite scene is the scene in the restaurant  when cristy is discussing painters with eileen  peter and her friends  here s where daniel day lewis reaches an acting climax   i ll kick you in the only part of your anatomy that s animated    wheel out the cripple   and his performance never slows down  never falters  and is beautiful  simply  he has a lot of screen time here  i watch it again again  and i never get tired of cristy s perspicacious eyes  twitching and guttural speeches  br    br   a must see  fo sho  yo ', 'my guess would be this was originally going to be at least two parts  and thus at least a quarter longer  because otherwise how can one explain its confused  abbreviated storyline  i was never completely lost  but i was often partially lost and usually unclear on character motivation  the movie feels as though joining plot points were dropped to squeeze it into its time slot  br    br   if it were longer  it might make more sense  but it still wouldn t be much good  the movie s most interesting idea is of the war between zeus and hera as being a war between the male and female  but the movie drops the ball on this  making hera s followers fairly horrible while not being clear on what zeus  followers do or believe  the movie is also interesting because you don t see the gods and there s no real certainty that they exist  so it s got a couple of intriguing ideas  but it doesn t do anything useful with them  br    br   bad dialog  cardboard characters  and one interesting scene involving hercules and his three antagonistic sons  not unwatchable but also not worth watching ', 'well  i like to watch bad horror b movies  cause i think it s interesting to see stupidity and unability of creators to shoot seriously good movie   i always compare this movies to   for example   some spielberg s works and again and again don t understand the huge difference in what i see   i like ed wood s movies cause it s so inept it s very funny  but people     the chilling  is not funny and is not even  interesting   it s extremely boring horror movie without anything what makes even bad movies watchable  there s no acting  no screenplay  no direction  no thrills and not even blood  it s extremely inept amateurish film  it s definitely the worst movie i had ever seen  and i had seen a lot of  worst movies    believe me   i warned you     1 10', 'this is the worst movie i have ever seen  as well as  the worst that i will probably ever see  i see no need to rehash what all the others have said previously  just be forewarned    br    br   this is not one of those bad movies you think you want to watch because you want to be able to make fun of it  its just plain bad bad bad bad bad  br    br   this movie is the equivalent to having a  pet rock  as your friend  you wait and wait and wait and wait and wait and wait and wait and wait for something to happen  unfortunately  it never does  at least with a pet rock you knew what you were getting into  lion s gate completely deceives on this bombshell    no   this is a disaster  after watching this film  you would swear george w  bush had his hands all over the making of this film    yes its that idiotic  br    br   stay away  unless of course you just want to watch the worst movie of all time  its probably how lion s gate figured it would make some money off this piece of tripe ', 'i have been a mario fan for as long as i can remember  i have very fond memories of playing super mario world as a kid  this game has brought back many of those memories while adding something new  super mario galaxy is the latest installment in the amazing mario franchise  there is much very different about this game from any other mario before it  while still keeping intact the greatest elements of mario  the first noticeable difference is that the story takes place in space  br    br   the story begins much like any other mario game  mario receives a letter from princess peach inviting him to a celebration at her castle in the mushroom kingdom  upon arriving at peach s castle mario finds bowser and his son  bowser jr   attacking the castle with their airships  bowser kidnaps princess peach and then lifts her castle up into space  in the midst of the castle being lifted into space mario falls off and lands on an unknown planet  mario is found by a talking star named luma and is taken back to the luma s home  a floating space station  here mario meets many other lumas and also meets their leader  a woman named rosalina  rosalina tells mario that bowser has taken away the space station s power stars and scattered them across the universe  it is up to mario to help the lumas find them and save peach  thus the adventure begins  br    br   the way you play the game is by flying from the space station to other galaxies  each galaxy consists of multiple planets that mario travels amongst in levels via these shooting stars to retrieve the power stars  mario can at many times walk all the way around planets without losing gravity  some planets are small and others are big  many planets are similar to classic mario environments  the best thing about the game are the controls  all of the stuff like jumping and such is still the same  but the wiimote is used in many unique ways in this game  you shake the remote mario will perform a spin that is used as the primary attack in the game  and it will as well activate the shooting stars  you can also point the remote at the screen and use the pointer to fire star bits at enemies or objects in the environment  then there is the graphics  these are by far the best graphics on the wii  it is just so hard to describe how great this game looks  you could probably almost say it looks as good as some 360 games  br    br   my only minor gripes is that the going upside down effect takes some getting used to  and also the story is pretty weak  the worst part is that you lose all of your lives when you turn off the game  no matter how many you had when you last quit you restart at 4 lives  still these minor problems aside it s a superb game that is highly entertaining and is very challenging  this is the type of game that we ve been waiting for on the wii  br    br   a perfect 10 out of 10 ']\n"
